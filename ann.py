### Importing the dataset
"""

"""### Encoding categorical data

Label Encoding the "Gender" column
"""

"""### Feature Scaling"""

#Crusial for ANN, scale all, even categorical features

# units are number of neurons in the first hidden layer we want
# we just guess and experiment with this value, no good rule of thumb

# set rectifier as the activation function for each neuron, 
# in ANN we must use rectifier activation function
activationFunction = 'relu'
# create the first layer

#add it

"""### Adding the second hidden layer"""

# add second layer which here is the same as first

"""### Adding the output layer"""

# since our output is binary we only need on neuron
units = 1
# we need sigmoid activation function so we get probabilistic prediction
